## 1. Project Overview

StagePoster is an **AI-native music event poster engine**. Core pipeline:

```
Structured Event Brief

Qwen3.5-9B Art Direction Agent
        ↓
3 Structured Design Plans
        ↓
ComfyUI + Z-Image Turbo → 3 Candidate Images
        ↓
User selects a candidate
        ↓
Go Deterministic Text / Logo / Info Layout
        ↓
Qwen Vision Review + Limited-Round Auto Optimization
        ↓
Final Poster + Thumbnail + Review Evidence
```

The frontend communicates only with the Go Backend. ComfyUI and vLLM are
internal services, never exposed to the browser.

## 2. Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Port |
|---|---|---|
| Go Backend | Go 1.25.0 + `net/http` | `:8080` |
| Database | SQLite (modernc.org/sqlite) | local file |
| Image Generation | ComfyUI + Z-Image Turbo | `:8188` |
| LLM / VLM | vLLM + Qwen3.5-9B | `:8001` |
| GPU Driver | ROCm 7.2 + HIP | — |
| Public Tunnel | Cloudflare Quick Tunnel | HTTPS |

Go dependencies are minimal — only `golang.org/x/image` and `modernc.org/sqlite`.
No external web framework.

## 4. Core Flows

### 4.1 Poster Generation State Machine

```
planning_candidates → generating_candidates → validating_candidates
                                                       ↓
                                                 partial_ready (1/3 ready)
                                                       ↓
                                                 awaiting_selection
                                                       ↓
                                                 selected → composing
                                                       ↓
                                                 succeeded / failed / canceled
```

- `worker/reconciler.go`: polls ComfyUI job status every 2s, transitions
  `generating` → `ready`/`failed`
- `worker/poster_reconciler.go`: advances poster flow state machine, triggers
  composition, review, finalize
- **Key**: `PartialReady` is NOT a terminal state. The reconciler must continue
  processing remaining candidates.

### 4.2 AI Session State Machine

```
collecting_brief → planning → awaiting_approval → generating
                                                        ↓
                                                  awaiting_candidate_selection
                                                        ↓
                                                  selected → composing → reviewing
                                                        ↓
                                                  succeeded / failed / canceled
```

- `assistant/service.go`: manages AI session lifecycle
- User messages trigger LLM calls, which decide the next action (plan / confirm
  / select / finalize)

## 6. Environment Variables

Key variables from `.env` (project root):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LISTEN_ADDR` | `:8080` | Backend listen address |
| `COMFY_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8188` | ComfyUI URL |
| `VLM_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8001` | vLLM URL |
| `VLM_API_KEY` | `stageposter-vlm-local` | vLLM API key |
| `VLM_MODEL` | `stageposter-vlm` | vLLM model name |
| `DB_PATH` | `backend/data/poster.db` | SQLite path |
| `STORAGE_ROOT` | `backend/storage/jobs` | Task output dir |
| `WORKFLOW_PATH` | `workflows/z_image_poster_v1.json` | ComfyUI workflow |
| `WORKFLOW_KEY` | `poster-text` | Workflow identifier |
| `WORKFLOW_VERSION` | `1.0.0` | Workflow version |
| `POSTER_API_TOKEN` | `""` | API auth token |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | `*` | CORS origin |
| `POSTER_FONT_REGULAR` | `""` | Regular font path |
| `POSTER_FONT_BOLD` | `""` | Bold font path |
| `RECONCILE_INTERVAL` | `2s` | Reconciler poll interval |
| `PROMPT_NODE_ID` | `57:27` | ComfyUI prompt node |
| `NEGATIVE_PROMPT_NODE_ID` | `57:34` | ComfyUI negative prompt node |
| `COMFY_CFG` | `""` | Sampler cfg override; empty keeps the workflow value (2). Negative prompts only apply when cfg > 1 |
| `SEED_NODE_ID` | `57:3` | ComfyUI seed node |
| `REFERENCE_CONTROL_PATCH` | `""` | Z-Image ControlNet patch filename under `ComfyUI/models/model_patches`. Enables reference-image conditioning; empty means reference images only reach the brief-understanding VLM call |

## 7. Known Constraints and Pitfalls

### ROCm / GPU
- vLLM `--enable-sleep-mode` causes `CUDA Error: invalid argument` on ROCm 7.2
  + vLLM 0.20.0. **Do not enable.**
- ComfyUI and vLLM share a single W7900. Qwen wake-up automatically unloads
  ComfyUI models (`ReleaseComfyMemory`).
- GPU architecture is `gfx1100`. Verify with `rocm-smi`.

### ComfyUI
- Workflow node IDs are fixed, configured via `PROMPT_NODE_ID` / `SEED_NODE_ID`.
- After submitting a prompt, the caller receives a `jobID`. The reconciler
  polls `/history/{prompt_id}` until `completed` or `failed`.
- Output images are in ComfyUI's output dir, copied to `STORAGE_ROOT` via
  `storage.FileStore`.
- **Reference-image conditioning is injected, not templated.** The workflow JSON
  has no reference nodes. When a request carries a reference asset,
  `comfy.Template.Build` injects `LoadImage` → `Canny` → `ModelPatchLoader` →
  `ZImageFunControlnet` into the *cloned* graph and rewires the sampler's `model`
  input through the ControlNet. Requests without a reference produce a
  byte-identical graph to before, which is what keeps this from regressing every
  existing caller. Do not move these nodes into the template file.
- The reference image must reach ComfyUI first: `comfy.Client.UploadImage` posts
  to `/upload/image` rather than writing into ComfyUI's `input/` directory, so a
  containerized or remote ComfyUI keeps working.

### SQLite
- Uses `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go, no CGO).
- Migrations are in `repository/sqlite.go` `Migrate()`.
- All queries use `context.Context` with timeout.

### Concurrency
- Two reconciler goroutines tick every 2s.
- **Must have panic recovery** — otherwise goroutines die silently.
- Session-level operations use `sync.Mutex` to prevent races.

---

## 8. API Design Conventions

- All POST request bodies are JSON.
- Error responses: `{"error": "message"}` + appropriate HTTP status.
- Success responses: `{"data": ...}` or the resource object directly.
- Pagination: list endpoints accept `?limit=` (1–100, default 20) and
  `?offset=` (default 0). Out-of-range values are rejected with 400 rather than
  silently clamped. The envelope carries `items []` plus `count` (rows in this
  page), `total` (rows in the table), `limit` and `offset`. Earlier revisions of
  this file documented a single `total int` and no `count`; the code only ever
  returned `count`, so both are now present and described as they are.
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <POSTER_API_TOKEN>` (optional, recommended for
  production).

---

## 9. Code Style

- **Package names**: lowercase short names under `internal/` (`api`, `domain`,
  `service`, `poster`, `assistant`, etc.)
- **Errors**: define package-level sentinel errors with `errors.New`. Never
  compare error strings.
- **Context**: all long operations accept `context.Context`. HTTP handlers pass
  `r.Context()`.
- **Logging**: use stdlib `log`. Structured logging recommended for production.
- **ID generation**: use `domain.NewID(prefix)` for `prefix_xxxxxxxx` format.
- **JSON**: field names use `json:"camelCase"` (`posterId`, `sessionId`,
  `createdAt`). This file previously said `snake_case`, which never matched the
  code. API request/response shapes are consistent.
- **Errors**: 500 responses return a generic `{"error":"internal server error"}`
  and log the real cause server-side. Never pass `err.Error()` to the client on
  a 500 — filesystem paths and driver internals leak that way.
- **File paths**: read absolute paths from env vars. Never hardcode.

---

## 10. Change Checklist

After modifying code:
- [ ] `go build ./cmd/server` compiles cleanly
- [ ] `go test ./...` passes
- [ ] Database changes → add migration in `repository/sqlite.go`
- [ ] New env vars → add to `.env.example` and `main.go` `env()` calls
- [ ] New ComfyUI node bindings → update node ID comments in `scripts/`
- [ ] Smoke test passes: `./scripts/smoke-test.sh`
- [ ] Full route regression: `python3 scripts/e2e-test.py all` (30 routes, 127 assertions)

## 11. Persistence and Backup

The cloud host gets reset, so "which directory does this live in" is a
correctness question, not an ops preference.

### Directory contract

The NFS persistence root is `/workspace/persistence`. This project uses
`/workspace/persistence/stageposter/`, and all four data paths in `.env` point
there:

```
DB_PATH             = /workspace/persistence/stageposter/data/poster.db
STORAGE_ROOT        = /workspace/persistence/stageposter/storage/jobs
ASSET_STORAGE_ROOT  = /workspace/persistence/stageposter/storage/assets
POSTER_OUTPUT_ROOT  = /workspace/persistence/stageposter/storage/posters
```

**`backend/data/poster.db` is a stale leftover, not the live database.** It is
still on disk and it is still what the documented `DB_PATH` *default* resolves
to. Backing up or debugging the wrong one yields data that looks plausible but
is days old. The only source of truth for the live path is `DB_PATH` in `.env`.

### Backup

```bash
bash scripts/backup-persistence.sh          # fast
bash scripts/backup-persistence.sh --hash   # adds weight sha256, slow
```

Output lands in `/workspace/persistence/stageposter/backups/<timestamp>/`, with
`backups/latest` symlinked to the newest. Each contains `RESTORE.md`
(step-by-step), a consistent DB snapshot, `env.backup`, a weight manifest, and
git state.

Three deliberate design choices — read these before changing the script:

1. **The DB uses `VACUUM INTO`, not `cp`.** With the backend live, the WAL can
   hold megabytes not yet checkpointed, so a plain copy is either stale or torn.
   `VACUUM INTO` takes a read snapshot and folds the WAL into one file; the
   script then runs `integrity_check` on *the snapshot*, because the claim worth
   asserting is "this backup is usable", not "the source isn't corrupt".
2. **`.env` must be backed up.** It is `.gitignore`d, so it is the only copy on
   the machine.
3. **The 43 GB of weights are not backed up, only inventoried.** There isn't
   that much free space. The manifest exists to verify a re-download — see below.

### Two traps when restoring

- **Re-downloading weights requires `HF_HUB_DISABLE_XET=1`.** huggingface.co is
  unreachable so downloads go through hf-mirror, but setting `HF_ENDPOINT` alone
  is not enough: Xet-backed large files bypass the mirror straight to
  `cas-server.xethub.hf.co` and 401. **Small files land, the weights don't, the
  directory looks populated, and the exit code can still be 0.** The only
  reliable check is byte sizes against `model-manifest.txt`.
- **Delete the old `-wal` / `-shm` when restoring a DB**, or SQLite will apply a
  stale WAL over the fresh file.

### Explicitly out of scope

`storage/` (candidates, final posters, uploaded assets, ~410 MB) exists only in
the persistence directory. If all of `/workspace/persistence` is lost, poster
history is lost and DB rows will reference missing files. This is a **known,
accepted** tradeoff: outputs are regenerable and the original briefs are in the
database.
